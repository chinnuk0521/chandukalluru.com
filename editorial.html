                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="drop-cap">In an era where data ownership and platform governance are increasingly important, the need for truly decentralized systems has never been more critical. At Clykur, we're building something different—a platform that empowers freelancers and businesses without the overhead of blockchain technology.</p>
                        <p>Our approach combines federation, cooperative governance, and modern peer-to-peer technologies to create a network where users maintain control of their data while benefiting from AI-driven project assistance and intelligent workflows.</p>
                        <p>The traditional freelance marketplace model has limitations: high fees, centralized control, and data silos. We're addressing these challenges by creating a cooperatively-owned platform where stakeholders have a voice in governance and decision-making.</p>
                        <p>Through my research at IIT Madras, I've seen firsthand how distributed ledger technologies can transform industries. However, not every problem requires blockchain. Sometimes, the solution lies in federated architectures and cooperative models that prioritize user control and efficiency.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-headline">Blockchain Research: Beyond the Hype</h3>
                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="drop-cap">During my time at IIT Madras, I've had the privilege of working on cutting-edge blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. The research focuses on practical applications: consensus mechanisms, smart contract security, and enterprise-grade solutions.</p>
                        <p>One of the most exciting areas is Hedera Hashgraph, which offers a different approach to distributed consensus. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hashgraph uses a gossip protocol and virtual voting to achieve consensus, resulting in faster transactions and lower fees.</p>
                        <p>Cryptography and cybersecurity are fundamental to this work. Ensuring data integrity and security in decentralized systems requires a deep understanding of cryptographic techniques, hashing algorithms, and secure protocol design.</p>
                        <p>My work on developing a proof-of-concept decentralized e-voting application using WebAssembly and WIDL demonstrated the practical potential of these technologies. The application showcased how DLTs can provide transparency, security, and verifiability in critical systems.</p>

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="drop-cap">Building scalable web applications requires more than just coding skills. It demands an understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, from requirement gathering to deployment and maintenance.</p>
                        <p>My experience as a Full-Stack Developer has taught me the importance of clean, scalable code. Whether working with React, React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python, the principles remain the same: write code that is maintainable, testable, and efficient.</p>
                        <p>Agile methodologies and Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices have been instrumental in delivering high-quality software solutions. These approaches ensure that code is not just functional, but also robust and adaptable to changing requirements.</p>
                        <p>Integration is another critical aspect. Working with RESTful APIs for payment gateways, authentication, and third-party services requires careful design and error handling. The goal is always to create seamless user experiences while maintaining system reliability.</p>

                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p class="drop-cap">In today's data-driven world, the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights is invaluable. My work with Power BI has shown me how effective data visualization can drive business decisions.</p>
                        <p>Designing ETL pipelines with automated error handling and validation is crucial for data integrity. These pipelines ensure that data flows smoothly from source to destination, with quality checks at every stage.</p>
                        <p>DAX calculations and data modeling are essential skills for creating meaningful dashboards. The goal is not just to display data, but to tell a story that helps stakeholders understand trends, identify opportunities, and make informed decisions.</p>
                        <p>Delivering Power BI dashboards with 90%+ accuracy requires attention to detail and a deep understanding of business requirements. It's about more than just charts and graphs—it's about creating tools that empower decision-makers.</p>
